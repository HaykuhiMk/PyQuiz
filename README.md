# PyQuiz

PyQuiz is an interactive quiz application designed to provide users with engaging multiple-choice questions across various topics. Built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JavaScript, PyQuiz offers a seamless experience for both users and administrators.

## Features

- **User Registration and Authentication:** Secure user sign-up and login functionalities.
- **Quiz Sessions:** Diverse multiple-choice questions to test users' knowledge.
- **Admin Panel:** Tools for administrators to manage questions and oversee user activities.
- **Token-Based Authentication:** Ensures secure access and interactions within the application.
- **MongoDB Integration:** Robust data storage and retrieval using MongoDB.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js:** Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
- **MongoDB:** Set up a MongoDB database, either locally or through a cloud provider.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HaykuhiMk/PyQuiz.git
   cd PyQuiz
   ```


2. **Install Backend Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```


3. **Configure Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following content:

   ```env
   MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```


   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB URI and `your_secret_key` with a secure key for JWT authentication.

4. **Start the Backend Server:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` by default.

5. **Install Frontend Dependencies:**

   Open a new terminal, navigate to the `frontend` directory, and run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```


6. **Start the Frontend Application:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```


   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **Access the Application:** Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser.
- **Register/Login:** Create a new account or log in with existing credentials.
- **Take Quizzes:** Participate in available quizzes and view your scores.
- **Admin Access:** Administrators can log in to manage questions and monitor user activities.
